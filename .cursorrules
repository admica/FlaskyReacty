Don't make assumptions. Ask questions for clarification instead of making any assumptions. Look through the application for code relevent to the request, then ensure all relevent code is thoroughly reviewed, then think step-by-step and describe your plan for what to do. Avoid removing code unrelated to the changes you wish to make. When working with React code, keep typescript types in mind when making changes.
